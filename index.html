        This changes how many frames pass before adding the next number in the sequence. Higher value = slower
        <h1>What is this??</h1>
        <p>
            A cool visualisation of the recaman sequence. It draws arcs alternatingly above and below the number
            line from the previous number in the sequence to the next. Inspired by Numberphile - see below.

        <h1>What's the recaman sequence, then?</h1>
        <p>
            The sequence starts at 0. To get the second number, I try to subract 1. To get the third, I try to
            subtract 2, and for the fourth, I try to subtract 3, etc. The catch is that if by doing that, I land
            on a number which I've already seen, or one which is negative, I increment by that number instead.

        <h1>That was a horrible explanation!! Where can I find a better one?</h1>

        <h1>Where can I find the source code?</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/j4cobgarby/recaman">Here!</a>... But the code was written very badly, since I learnt javascript
            at the same time as writing this! Also no comments. Any contributions welcome :)
